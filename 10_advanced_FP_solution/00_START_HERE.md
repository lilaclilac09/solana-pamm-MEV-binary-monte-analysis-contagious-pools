## 🎯 The 5 Core Detection Methods

### Method 1: Victim Check (PRIMARY)
- **What**: Identifies wrapped victims between attacker's front-run and back-run
- **Fat Sandwich**: ≥2 victims mandatory
- **Multi-Hop**: 0 victims required
- **Confidence Weight**: 0.35

### Method 2: Token Pair Analysis
- **What**: Analyzes from_token and to_token sequences
- **Fat Sandwich**: Same pair throughout (e.g., PUMP↔WSOL)
- **Multi-Hop**: Cyclic path (e.g., SOL→A→B→SOL)
- **Confidence Weight**: 0.25

### Method 3: Pool Routing Diversity
- **What**: Counts unique pools and token pairs
- **Fat Sandwich**: 1-2 pools (concentrated)
- **Multi-Hop**: 3+ pools (distributed)
- **Confidence Weight**: 0.20

### Method 4: Cycle Routing Validation
- **What**: Validates perfect cycle and net balance
- **Fat Sandwich**: Non-zero balance (profit kept)
- **Multi-Hop**: Zero balance (arbitrage closed)
- **Confidence Weight**: 0.35

### Method 5: Timing & Oracle Signals
- **What**: Correlates with Oracle bursts and timing
- **Fat Sandwich**: 99.8% Oracle burst correlation
- **Multi-Hop**: ~50% optional Oracle dependency
- **Confidence Weight**: 0.20

## 🔍 Real-World Application Examples

### Example 1: Clear Fat Sandwich
```
Cluster characteristics:
  ✓ 2 victims found between attacker's trades
  ✓ Only PUMP/WSOL pair throughout
  ✓ 1 pool targeting same pair
  ✓ 150ms execution time
  ✓ Oracle burst detected

→ Classification: FAT SANDWICH (95% confidence)
```

### Example 2: Clear Multi-Hop Arbitrage
```
Cluster characteristics:
  ✓ 0 intermediate victims
  ✓ Cyclic path: SOL→TokenA→TokenB→SOL
  ✓ 3+ pools from different protocols
  ✓ Net balance = 0 for all tokens
  ✓ No Oracle dependency

→ Classification: MULTI-HOP ARBITRAGE (98% confidence)
```

### Example 3: Ambiguous Pattern
```
Cluster characteristics:
  ? Multiple signers (could be related bots)
  ? Partial cycle (incomplete path)
  ? Mixed indicators

→ Classification: AMBIGUOUS (requires manual review)
```

## 💡 Key Insights

### Why Victims Matter Most
The presence of wrapped victims is the PRIMARY differentiator because:
- Fat Sandwich BY DEFINITION extracts value from victims
- Multi-Hop arbitrage NEVER wraps victims—it's pure routing arbitrage
- Can't have 2+ victims by chance in legitimate routing

### Why Token Path Reveals Intent
- Same pair = Attacker wants to maximize impact on one asset
- Cyclic path = Attacker wants to return to starting asset

### Why Net Balance is Definitive
- If balance returns to zero = Perfect arbitrage closure
- If balance remains = Value extracted from someone (victims)

### Why Oracle Correlation Confirms Sandwich
- 99.8% of sandwiches follow Oracle bursts because:
  - Bot waits for price signal
  - Executes within milliseconds after update
  - Time-critical back-running window
